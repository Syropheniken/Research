#### A list of questions to answer/topics to cover in no particular order

- If the Signs do not derive their origin from the myths and legends associated with their respectively named constellations...
  1. Do they still retain associated trats and themes that can be abstracted from the myths and traditional/modern meanings?
  2. If so, where do these associations actually come from?
  3. Assuming that there is in fact significance in the relationship of the signs and Ecliptic plane, is it accurate to evenly divide them? What other factors might affect this?

- the Ecliptic plane is the plane in which the Earth orbits the Sun, changing what is possible to be seen above the Horizon, and the Sun being big enough and close enough to have obvious affects on the Earth, is anything else that falls onto the plane arbitrary?
  1. The other planets, all oribiting the sun, have their own ecliptic. 
    - what is the point in projecting the planets on to the Earth's ecliptic?
    - Under the assumption that planets can have a direct affect on us, How is it possible if we interpret them as if they were somewhere other than they actually are? How accurate are the interpretations of their "pretend" positions?
    - If the Heavens are not causal and simply mirror the conditions on the Earth, how does projecting their positions to the Earth's Ecliptic Plane distort the image of the mirror?
  2. If the Ecliptic is the most important thing in astrology where everything important is measured against it, and we use the mean ecliptic of the 7 traditional visible planets because they all fall very close to the Earth's, when and why did the outter planets and asteroids become exceptions?
