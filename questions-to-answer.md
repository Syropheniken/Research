#### A list of questions to answer/topics to cover in no particular order

- If the Signs do not derive their origin from the myths and legends associated with their respectively named constellations...
  - Do they still retain associated traits and themes that can be abstracted from the myths and traditional/modern meanings?
  - If so, where do these associations actually come from?
  - Assuming that there is in fact significance in the relationship of the signs and Ecliptic plane, is it accurate to evenly divide them? What other factors might affect this?

- the Ecliptic plane is the plane in which the Earth orbits the Sun, changing what is possible to be seen above the Horizon, and the Sun being big enough and close enough to have obvious affects on the Earth, is anything else that falls onto the plane arbitrary?
  - The other planets, all orbiting the sun, have their own ecliptic,
    - what is the point in projecting the planets on to the Earth's ecliptic?
    - Under the assumption that planets can have a direct affect on us, How is it possible if we interpret them as if they were somewhere other than they actually are? How accurate are the interpretations of their "pretend" positions?
    - If the Heavens are not causal and simply mirror the conditions on the Earth, how does projecting their positions to the Earth's Ecliptic Plane distort the image of the mirror?
  -. If the Ecliptic is the most important thing in astrology where everything important is measured against it, and we use the mean ecliptic of the 7 traditional visible planets because they all fall very close to the Earth's, when and why did the outer planets and asteroids become exceptions? 
  
  -. People often talk about when Planets, particularly the Sun and the Moon, transition from one sign to another - Are they in fact referencing their appearance in a constellation? 
    - What is the difference in interpreting an objects actual location in a part of the sky and interpreting their perceived positions both on the ecliptic plane and in the exact 30 degree Sign divisions of the Ecliptic if the size of the constellations varies?
    - The Sun and Moon placements in a chart can fall very close to their actual positions in the sky. 
      - As of March 19 2019, 1:39, the Moon in a chart is in Virgo, and very close to moving into Leo. The Moon in the actual sky appears to have already been in Leo 
      - The Sun in a chart is at the Cusp of Pisces and Aries. Those with an interest in Astrology have noted this transition as being a big deal, as this transition marks the Spring Equinox, and thus the beginning of the Zodiac (0 Aries). The Sun in the sky appears to be entering Aquarius.
      - When talking about the Sun entering Aries, people might note a shift in the overall energy of the locality, making references to Aries' fiery, trend-setting, initiative energy. Should this in energy not be more attributed to the Spring equinox?
      - This is not to imply that the Sun's movement has no relevance
